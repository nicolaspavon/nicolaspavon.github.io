              <p>
                In today's world, corruption is an issue that affects every
                country. Therefore, having a standard to store government
                purchases, like the

                <a href="https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/"
                  >Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS).</a
                >, plays a vital role in uncovering fraudulent activities and
                financial misuse by the government. Luckily, in my home country,
                Uruguay, this standard has been used since 2015 to store a wide
                range of government purchases, and this data is publicly
                available for free use on the
                <a

                >.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this case study, we will analyze this data in search of
                interesting patterns and characteristics, which hopefully (or
                not), will reveal some misuse of government funds.
              </p>

              <h3 class="major">inspiration</h3>
              <p>
                While looking for a interesting dataset to demonstrate my ML
                skills, i came across the website
                <a href="http://cuentasclaras.uy/#/home">Cuentas claras</a> . In
                there, the owners try to reveal fraudulent purchases and misuse
                of government founds by applying a "function", which analyzes
                certain parameters and returns a value, in their case, "red
                flags". This idea of "red flags" is not new, and as we can see
                in the
                <a
                  href="https://www.open-contracting.org/2016/11/30/red-flags-integrity-giving-green-light-open-data-solutions/"
                  >>OCDS website</a
                >, this was already attempted by a few countries, and there are
                guides to work the OCDS data looking for these red flags.

              <p>
                I strongly reccomend taking a look into the website and explore
                it. As you can see in the image above, they have succesfully
                processed and classified purchases of many public government
                organizations, marking them with the famous "red flags". Also
                there are some interesting statistics to explore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sadly the "Cuentas claras" proyect does not provide the
                processed data along with the "red flags", and after some failed
                attempts in contacting the owners, it seems to be abandoned or
                in standby state.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is not good news. In order to train a predicting model wee
                need already labelled data, luckily, the folks at "cuentas
                claras" <i>kind of</i> described the process they took to flag
                the organisms in
                <a href="http://cuentasclaras.uy/#/documentation"
                  >these documents</a
                >. Taking this into account, there are two possible paths to
                continue working on this. We either "manually" label the data by
                processing it with a similar function to the one used by cuentas
                claras, or we try to apply clustering algorithms to identify
                patterns and groupings, and then see if we can notice any odd
                patterns that may indicate suspicious activity. <br />
                Or, we may try both approaches.

                organization it should be possible (in theory) to determine if a
                certain purchase was 'suspicious,' as it provides a list with
                possible 'red flags,' indicating the conditions that a purchase
                must meet to raise suspicions.
                <br />
                After a brief investigation, we reached the conclusion that
                determining that case by case is not a good idea for two
                reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We are not qualified to analyze purchases and determine
                  suspicious activities, since despite having that guide, we
                  could never know with precision if it was truly a fraudulent
                  purchase due to lack of context
                </li>
                <li>Labeling all that data is a very arduous and slow task.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="major">Applying clustering</h3>
              <p>
                Although it wasn't the initial idea, by using clustering
                algorithms, we can study the information in different ways and
                eventually extract interesting conclusions. We might even be
                able to highlight certain purchases with interesting patterns...
                outliers.

              <p>
                The OCDS standard aims to store government procurement
                information in a clear, concise, and detailed manner. To achieve
                this, it provides a series of guides available on its website:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/es/data-standard/"
                    >Introduction to the standard</a
                  >
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After further investigation of the standard, we concluded that a
                procurement process is broadly composed of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>A planning stage (Planning)</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Information about the planning phase of the procurement
                      process. This includes information related to the process
                      of deciding what to contract, when, and how.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>A bidding stage (Tender)</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The activities carried out to award a contract.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>An awarding stage (Awards)</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Information about the awarding phase of the procurement
                      process. There may be more than one award per procurement
                      process; for example, because the contract is divided
                      among different suppliers, or because it is an ongoing
                      offer.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>A contracting stage(Contracts)</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Information about the contract creation phase in the
                      procurement process.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As you can see, this is not a simple process. It consists of
                several stages that we won't delve into deeply for practical
                reasons, but in an ideal scenario, we can conclude that the
                standard seeks to be thorough and comprehensive when managing
                this information.
              </p>
              <h4 class="major">Red flags</h4>
              <p>
                After studying and understanding the standard, we further
                investigated the famous 'red flags', where we found
                <a
                  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12PFkUlQH09jQvcnORjcbh9-8d-NnIuk4mAQwdGiXeSM/edit#gid=2027439485"

                >
                which explains in detail several possible cases of fraudulent
                activities
              </p>
              <p>From this guide, we highlight some examples.:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The available time to apply for the tender is very short (less
                  than 2 days)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The tender does not have a clear criterion for selecting the
                  applicant nor key information such as dates, budget, etc.
                </li>
                <li>The tender is by invitation only.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These are the clearest examples we can observe, but there are a
                total of 64 possible red flags 🤯
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking these red flags into account along with the data
                available in the standard, we make a pre-selection of the data
                that interests us. This list can be seen in detail in the team's
                repository
              </p>
              <h4 class="major">¿What about N-1 relations?</h4>
              <p>
                Considering that RapidMiner works (initially) with CSV files,
                where all the information about a purchase is in one row, it
                would not be possible to process purchases that contain N-1
                relationships, where, for example, there are several bidders
                with different data for each one. So to study this problem, it's
                best to start with the simple path, selecting examples that can
                be processed using RapidMiner. To deal with this, we have
                developed a script that iterates over all purchases in an
                OCDS-formatted file, summarizing the relevant information from
                purchases that are good candidates for processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was not a simple task, as we first had to define what
                information about a purchase is relevant based on the red flags
                definitions by OCDS, and then deal with the schema to
                successfully extract it, resolving different conflicts along the
                way such as the use of different currencies to indicate prices,
                among other issues. Feel free to contact me for more details
                about it.
              </p>
              <h4 class="major">Uruguayan data</h4>
              <p>
                Once we've assembled a script to condense the data into a CSV
                with relevant information, we process the available data from
                the Uruguay site and observe the worst... while data has been
                stored in quantity since 2002, this data is incomplete,
                containing only information on the quantity of items purchased
                and their unit price.
              </p>
              <h4 class="major">Buenos Aires data</h4>
              <p>
                Although this seemed like the end of the project, we remembered
                that this is an international standard and many countries follow
                it. After conducting a brief investigation, we found on their
                website
                <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/worldwide/#/">
                  a map with the countries adhering to the standard</a
                >, where we observe Argentina. We enter the Argentine data
                website, download the dataset, and after processing it, we
                observe that it contains many more data points than the
                Uruguayan dataset.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>But... is it enough?</p>

              <h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
              After applying clustering algorithms, we obtain somewhat
              discouraging results. We understand that patterns are detected,
              but nothing that strikes us as interesting at first glance.
              Although it is not the result we expected, we highlight that it is
              a great tool, and with more knowledge of the problem and quality
              data, it would be possible to find anomalies in the procurement
              processes of countries.

              <h3 class="major">Future of the project</h3>
              One potential direction to further develop this project is by
              generating mock data. Thanks to the comprehensive work carried out
              by the OCDS standard, we have a clear understanding of the types
              of purchases that could raise red flags. Thus, we could generate
              multiple purchases with fabricated but detailed data that meet the
              criteria for red flags. Once this step is completed, we could
              theoretically train a machine learning model to identify these
              patterns, or alternatively, apply clustering algorithms to
              recognize how outliers would manifest within clusters formed using
              real data

              However, it is important to have in mind that in order to
              correctly process government purchases with a ML model, first, we
              need the data to be complete with relevant information, which at
              least for the Uruguayan government, it's not the case.
