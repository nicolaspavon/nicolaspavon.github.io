              <p>
                Across the globe, many people are dealing with kidney diseases.
                These can show up suddenly due to various risk factors like what
                they eat, their surroundings, and how they live. Checking for
                these diseases can be invasive, expensive, and slow. It might
                even be risky. This is why, especially in places with limited
                resources, lots of patients don't get diagnosed and treated
                until their kidney disease is already advanced. So, finding ways
                to spot these diseases early is really important, especially in
                developing countries where late diagnosis is common.
              </p>

              <h3 class="major">The data:</h3>
              <p>
                There are many datasets containing information of patients with
                this desease that can be worked on to achieve our objective,
                predict chronic kidney disease. In this case we are going to use
                the dataset provided by the UCI repository. Looking at the
                description of the dataset and the data itself we can define the
                types and roles of the attributes:

              <p>
                When importing the data, we noticed that it's necessary to
                modify the types of several attributes because RapidMiner didn't
                do a good job automatically.
              </p>

                /></span>
              </div>
              <p>
                We observe that most of the attributes are recognized as
                'polynomial,' even though only a few of them should be. We edit
                all the attributes, assigning the types defined in the table
                above. Remove rows that might cause issues (for example, if a
                row contains 'no' in the 'class' column. It could be interpreted
                as 'notckd,' but since it's a single value and we are not
                certain, removing it won't cause problems). Finally, we renamed
                the attributes to make their names more descriptive and easier
                to work with.

                  It's a dataset with many missing values for various
                  attributes.

                <li>The 'class' attribute is fairly balanced.</li>
                <li>
                  The 'potassium' column contains 2 outliers: we assume that a
                  decimal point was omitted in the input, as the values 47 and
                  39 would make more sense if they were 4.7 and 3.9.

                  we have identified values such as 76, 32, and 24 mg/dl, which
                  are considerably elevated for a typical individual. A brief
                  research indicates that normal values typically range from 0.7
                  to 1.3 mg/dl, significantly lower than the values that have
                  raised suspicion. Nonetheless, it's important to consider that
                  these values could be attributed to an unwell patient, making
                  them potentially valid. As a result, we have decided to retain
                  these values in their current form. However, we will remain
                  vigilant regarding their potential impact in the future and
                  conduct a more thorough investigation to determine whether
                  they should be classified as outliers.

              <h3 class="major">Dealing with missing values</h3>
              <p>
                When examining the statistics, we notice a substantial presence
                of missing values. Dealing with this issue offers several
                approaches. We can choose to substitute them with averages or
                logically derived data, remove rows containing missing values
                entirely, or employ machine learning methods to predict the
                missing values based on available data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, it's essential to be cautious with these
                techniques, as they might introduce inaccurate data into the
                system, potentially compromising or deteriorating the final
                outcome. Additionally, some algorithms are capable of
                accommodating missing values. Therefore, in our initial version,
                we will work with the missing values in their current state. If
                we identify room for improvement, we can explore these
                techniques at a later stage.

              <h3 class="major">Studying correlated attributes</h3>
              <p>
                Once in RapidMiner we can quicly make use of the
                <i>Correlation matrix</i> operator to find out more info about
                these attributes
              </p>
              <div class="col-12">

                /></span>
              </div>
              <p>
                At first sight we cant find heavily correlated attributes. The
                most correlation is between the <b>class</b> atribute with
                <b>Hemoglobin</b>, <b>packed cell volume</b> and
                <b>red blood count</b>. However the correlation value does not
                exceed 0.77, so for now we will leave it as it is.

              <h3 class="major">Modelling</h3>
              <p>
                Now to the fun part! We will start processing the data with some
                ML models to find out if we can predict the target value. Since
                we are going to try to classify new incoming data into two
                possible outcomes <i>ckd</i> and <i>notckd</i>, we can clearly
                identify this as a classification problem, therefore we will
                make use of classification models.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some classification models that we can make ous of are
                <b>Logistic regression</b>, <b>Linear discriminant analysis</b>,
                <b>KNN</b> and <b>Naive bayes</b>
              </p>
              <h4 class="major">Validation</h4>
              <p>
                To assess the performance of the models, we will employ the
                <b>Cross-Validation</b> operator from RM, using a 5-fold
                strategy. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into
                five subsets, and the model is trained and validated five times.
                Each fold serves as the validation set exactly once, ensuring
                thorough assessment. This approach not only utilizes all
                available data but also tests the model's ability to generalize
                to unseen data, making it a robust validation method.
              </p>
              <h4 class="major">Feature selection</h4>
              <p>
                We can see that there are many attributes with information here.
                Some of these attributes may not be useful, and may also impact
                negatively not only the performance in terms of efficiency, but
                the outcome itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                To analyze these attributes in search of the most useful ones,
                we can employ various techniques. However, we will opt for the
                RM operator called <b>Optimize Selection (evolutionary)</b>.
                This operator essentially repeats the entire process multiple
                times, selecting different attributes each time and evaluating
                their performance. Ultimately, this operator will help us
                identify the most useful attributes, resulting in improved
                performance. On a side note, we choose 'evolutionary' because it
                is the option most likely to prevent reaching a local maximum.
              </p>
              <h3 class="major">Logistic regression</h3>
              <p>
                Lets work with the first algorithm, logistic regression. We plug
                it in the cross validation operator and press play

              <p>
                Seems a little too good to be true, doesn't it? There may be
                some issues with the data that leads to such a good, but false
                outcome. Also, playing around with the operators we observed
                that the <b>Optimize Selection</b> operator raised the
                performance from 98% to 100%. Even tough this may be a
                misleading result, we will keep working with the other models to
                see how they perform.

                LDA does not support working with missing values, but we are
                going to try it anyways filling the data with average values.
                This is not a good idea because its made up information, but we
                are going to try it anyways just to see how it performs. Also,
                it doesn't support binomial or polynomial attributes. To solve
                this we will use the operator <b>Nominal to numerical</b>, which
                will transform the values of binomial and polynomial attributes
                to numerical ones.

              <p>
                Not bad to have so many made up values. playing around with the
                operators we found out that when leaving out the rows with
                missing values (a lot of rows), it had a 61% success
                performance, and autocompleting missing values upgraded it to
                90%. This is probably due to the very little examples in the
                dataset that have all the attributes complete. Also we noted
                that the operator <b>Optimize Selection</b>
                raised the performance from 90% to 96%! We can clearly see that
                this operator rocks.

                Really good performance! We accomplished this after some
                tweaking with the knn operator parameters, and also some data
                preprocessing. Running it in the first instance resulted in 61%
                performance. After that we implemented the
                <b>Normalize</b> operator, which normalized every attribute.
                This is especially good for KNN, upgrading it's peformance to
                91%. After this we tweaked the <b>k</b> parameter of the KNN
                operator, finding out that the values around "25" turned out to
                be the most performant ones, upgrading the performance to
                95.49%. Lastly, we used the trusty operator

              <p>
                All these performances seem too good to be true, and this is a
                bit unsetteling. However after some time thinking of reasons it
                may work <i>too good</i>, I couldn't find a satisfactory
                explanation. After all, thanks to the
                <b>cross validation</b> operator, the models should not be
                suffering of overfitting, which should be a reason to have such
                high performance. To continue working on this, the best approach
                to further validate the models would be to use another dataset
                that is very similar and already classified, and test the
                performances to see if it actually works as well as it shows.
                Lastly, the MVP of this study case will be the operator
                <b>Optimize Selection</b>, wich optimized every model, from a
                resource efficiency point of view, to the overall performance of
                all of them. 🥳
