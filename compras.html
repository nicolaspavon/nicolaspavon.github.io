              <p>
                In today's world, corruption is an issue that affects every
                country. Therefore, having a standard to store government
                purchases, like the
                <a href="https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/"
                  >Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS).</a
                >, plays a vital role in uncovering fraudulent activities and
                financial misuse by the government. Luckily, in my home country,
                Uruguay, this standard has been used since 2015 to store a wide
                range of government purchases, and this data is publicly
                available for free use on the
                <a
                  href="https://catalogodatos.gub.uy/dataset/arce-datos-historicos-de-compras"

                webpage.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this case study, we will analyze this data in search of
                interesting patterns and characteristics, which hopefully (or
                not), will reveal some misuse of government funds.
              </p>

              <h3 class="major">inspiration</h3>
              <p>
                While looking for a interesting dataset to demonstrate my ML
                skills, i came across the website
                <a href="http://cuentasclaras.uy/#/home">Cuentas claras</a> . In
                there, the owners try to reveal fraudulent purchases and misuse
                of government founds by applying a "function", which analyzes
                certain parameters and returns a value, in their case, "red
                flags". This idea of "red flags" is not new, and as we can see
                in the
                <a
                  href="https://www.open-contracting.org/2016/11/30/red-flags-integrity-giving-green-light-open-data-solutions/"
                  >OCDS website</a
                >, this was already attempted by a few countries, and there are
                guides to work the OCDS data looking for these red flags.
                <br />
              </p>
              <div class="col-12">
                <span class="image fit"
                  ><img src="images/claras.png" alt="" />
                  <p><i>Cuentas claras website</i></p></span
                >
              </div>
              <p>
                I strongly reccomend taking a look into the website and explore
                it. As you can see in the image above, they have succesfully
                processed and classified purchases of many public government
                organizations, marking them with the famous "red flags". Also
                there are some interesting statistics to explore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sadly the "Cuentas claras" proyect does not provide the
                processed data along with the "red flags", and after some failed
                attempts in contacting the owners, it seems to be abandoned or
                in standby state.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is not good news. In order to train a predicting model wee
                need already labelled data, luckily, the folks at "cuentas
                claras" <i>kind of</i> described the process they took to flag
                the organisms in
                <a href="http://cuentasclaras.uy/#/documentation"
                  >these documents</a
                >. Taking this into account, there are two possible paths to
                continue working on this. We either "manually" label the data by
                processing it with a similar function to the one used by cuentas
                claras, or we try to apply clustering algorithms to identify
                patterns and groupings, and then see if we can notice any odd
                patterns that may indicate suspicious activity. <br />
                Or, we may try both approaches.
              </p>
              <h3 class="major">Manually labelling the data</h3>
              <p>
                The idea of labelling the data with a function seems a little
                odd. Why would we use AI to predict this if we can just use a
                simple function?
